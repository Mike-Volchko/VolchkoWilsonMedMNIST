1.	If the network converges as Figure 2 shows, study the “Results” section.  Do they make sense? Why do you say so?
The results show the initial values (X1, X2, and X3) and the expected output (t1) alongside it. 
When the expected output is 1, the y1 value is very close to 1; and when the expected output is 0 the y1 value is close
to 0. Based on this, the results make sense because the program is predicting the answer within a 1% error.


2.	How many runs did you do in total, including the initial run in the prior step?
The program was run 10 times.


3.	How many times does it converge in those runs?
Out of the 10 times, the program was run, it converged 6 times.


4.	What’s the minimum training error of the last successful run in which the network converged?
The minimum error was: 0.0098

5.	How many epochs did it take in the last successful run in which the network converged?
It took 83 epochs.
